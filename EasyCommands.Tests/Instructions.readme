### Test Setup

When setting this up in Visual Studio, you will need to ensure that you've added references to:
* EasyCommands project
* MDKUtilities
* Sandbox.Common
* Sandbox.Game
* Sandbox.Graphics
* SpaceEngineers.Game
* SpaceEngineers.ObjectBuilders
* VRage.Game
* VRage.Math
* Also, use NuGet to take a dependency on Moq (see the packages.config file)

This is all required for the tests to function properly.
